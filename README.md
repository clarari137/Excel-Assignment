# Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
We can draw a few conclusions based on this dataset and the visualizations we created. This data helps us quantify what the crowdfunding environment can look like in terms of how projects are classified as well as which characteristics may be correlated with project success. My three conclusions are listed below. 

1. The crowdfunding environment is diverse. There were 565 total successful projects, 364 failed projects, and 71 projects that are live or were canceled. The projects studied can be organized into 9 groups and 49 sub-categories. The theater/play category and subcategory saw the greatest number of projects with 344. The journalism category had the least number of projects with only four. Further, the most common month to start a campaign was July, with 94 total projects, and the least common was September with 73.

2. In terms of successes, the data can show which characteristics successful projects may share. For example, projects started in June and July higher success rates; 63.2% and 61.7%respectively. 

3. Some failed projects also shared characteristics. The goal analysis shows that most projects (53.4%) with goals of greater than 50,000 failed. 
# What are some limitations of this dataset?
One limitation is that is that the scope and size of the dataset is limited, so it is difficult to draw conclusions and make predictions. This dataset only samples 1,000 projects from 7 countries. Of those, 76 percent are projects in the U.S. So, any conclusion being drawn about the likelihood of success of a project may not be valid if applied to projects launched in a country not included in this dataset, or a country with less representation in the data, especially if there are characteristics not captured in the data that are impacting the success of a project. 

Another limitation is that the currency is not consistent across each project. This means that two projects in with very similar goals, like Miller LTD (198,600) and Farrell and Sons (196,500) are both grouped in the same bucket and counted as “failures” in the goals analysis. However, the Farrell and Sons goal is in Australian dollars, while Miller is in US dollars. This means comparisons across these buckets may not be valid without more cleaning of the data to ensure that units are constant throughout the whole table or using precents in place of direct comparisons of this monetary data. 
# What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
I would be interested to chart the duration of campaigns in each project category to see if there were similarities in terms of how long projects stayed open. This could be done similar to the goal analysis, making buckets of how many days a project was open and showing the count of successful projects per category or even other variables like the country. It would also be informative to show the variance in duration for projects that ultimately failed or were successful, helping to further illustrate characteristics of a successful campaign. 

Graphing the country of origin and the monetary goals would also help to show a more complete picture of which projects had success. For example, maybe goals in one country could be lower and still see similar success rates to that of another. While I mentioned above that this data poses limitations in terms of currencies and conversions, looking at the percent of successful projects and other descriptive statistics could inform further research into kickstarter campaigns.
